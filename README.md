### Hi there, I'm [Ankush Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankush-kumar-06b22b191/) 👋

I am an intermediate back-end developer, graphic and Adobe designer working for the past few years. I am always enthusiastic about new creative projects for which I use my imagination and skill to provide an elegant solution for any project. My main objective is to create beautiful digital products and provide unique design solutions. Always open to challenges that will keep me learning. Looking forward to working on exciting upcoming projects with innovative people.


- 💻 {( Currently working as a back-end developer at YouthIndiaFoundation-NewDelhi, it is a type of [NGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization) and our team is currently working on a project named as YIE-       School. )}
- 🧑‍ {( I have always had the ability to look at things from a different perspective and try to find something new in them. I hope that with every new day, I get more than one chance to learn everything, which will make me very happy. New technologies have always been an inspiration to learn and at the same time get an opportunity to learn something from them. )}
